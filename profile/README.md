## What is PDF OCR X?  

PDF OCR X is a lightweight yet powerful application designed to convert scanned documents and images into fully searchable, editable PDF files on macOS. Built with advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, it automatically detects and extracts text from images, making it ideal for digitizing printed documents, books, receipts, and more.  

Manually retyping text from scanned pages can be extremely time-consuming and prone to mistakes. PDF OCR X solves this problem by accurately identifying characters and formatting in just a few clicks. With support for multiple languages and different file types, it ensures that even complex documents are processed with speed and precision.  

The app features a simple drag-and-drop interface, allowing users to process files quickly without dealing with complicated menus or settings. Whether you need to convert a single image or batch process hundreds of pages, PDF OCR X provides the flexibility to handle both small and large projects efficiently.  

One of the standout aspects of PDF OCR X is its high accuracy in character recognition. The software is perfect for professionals, students, researchers, and businesses who rely on accurate text extraction for archiving, editing, or sharing documents digitally.  

The application also supports a wide range of input formats, including PNG, JPEG, TIFF, and PDF files, making it versatile for different scanning and document workflows. Once processed, your documents become fully searchable, editable, and easy to integrate with other apps like text editors or PDF management tools.  

Optimized for the latest macOS versions, including Ventura and Sonoma, PDF OCR X takes full advantage of Apple Silicon chips (M1, M2, M3), ensuring fast and efficient performance. Whether you’re handling occasional scans or managing a high-volume document conversion workflow, the app delivers consistent, reliable results.
